# Project-3---Temperature-Converter
Simple temperature converter to convert from Celsius to Farenheit and vice-versa !
This is basically a modofied version of Project 2, adapted to temperatures.
I could improve on it by making it more seameless and hassle-free, as well as adding the degree signs, however the important is that it works well and is comprehensive. 
Once again, these are just a couple of simple, beginner projects.
